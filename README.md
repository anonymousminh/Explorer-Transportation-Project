# Explorer-Transportation-Project

Thrilled to share that Iâ€™ve completed the NEBDHub & NSDC Transportation Data Science Project (TDSP)! ðŸš—ðŸ“Š

This incredible opportunity, provided by the Northeast Big Data Innovation Hub (NEBDHub) and the National Student Data Corps (NSDC), allowed me to delve into a dataset of crash incidents from NYC OpenData (2012â€“2024) with insights from the NYPD. Over the past three months, I tackled six milestones, each refining my skills and understanding:

ðŸ”¶ Data Preparation 

ðŸ”¶ Data Ethics, Pre-Processing, and Exploration 

ðŸ”¶ Time Series Analysis

ðŸ”¶ Geospatial Analysis

ðŸ”¶ Self-Guided Research Question 

ðŸ”¶ Virtual Poster Board Creation: Data Storytelling 

Through this analysis of over 2 million rows of data, I uncovered fascinating trends in accident patterns across New York boroughs. The results remained consistent even during COVID-19.

I want to express my heartfelt gratitude to Ms. Emily Rothenberg, Northeast Big Data Innovation Hub, National Student Data Corps, and the U.S. Department of Transportation for this invaluable experienceâ€”special thanks to the mentors and community members who supported and guided me throughout this journey.
